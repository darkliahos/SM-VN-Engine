# SM-VN-Engine 
![Travis build status](https://app.travis-ci.com/darkliahos/SM-VN-Engine.svg?branch=master)

A super simple engine that allows for scripting of Japanese style visual novel games

## A bit of an introduction

This was started as a collaberation project at some point in 2012/2013 and some early progress was done on it, it was decided to revive this project from the dead and create something worthwhile. There are two projects, one is a web version in Electron (most of it is hardcoded), the other is a more complete engine using openTK, neither of them are finished and are probably pre-alpha. 

## Future of this repo
Very slow progress will be made to get this fully functional to spec 0.05, feel free to contribute by taking a look at help wanted issues or for raising some discussions around this repo.
